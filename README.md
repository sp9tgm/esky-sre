## Assigment 1

### Description

The task was to create a script called `script.sh` that will extract content of this archive and parse those log, so a number of request per IP can be shown. Script also has additional options `--user-agent` and `--method` to restrict parsing to provided user agent or request method.
Additionally I've added the -h|--help option, wchich print help message with usage examples.

### Running script

cd ./assigment-1
./script.sh OPTION
```
